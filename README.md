The kevin. Android SDK enables to easily integrate AIS and PIS services in your mobile application. We provide neat, customisable UI screens so integration would be as quick as possible. We also expose the low-level APIs that power those UIs so that you can build fully custom experiences.

Get started with our [SDK reference](https://developer.kevin.eu/home/mobile-sdk/android) and checkout our [Demo App](https://github.com/getkevin/kevin-android/tree/master/demo).

## Features

- **Account linking** - we provide an easy solution to authenticate and manage user bank accounts.
- **Bank payments** - we provide a possibility to integrate bank payments in your app with both SCA and non-SCA options.
- **Card payments** - we also provide card payments with a hybrid payment support, so the payment would be performed via bank if we detect that the card belongs to one of our supported banks.

## Documentation

- SDK documentation can be found [here](https://developer.kevin.eu/mobile/)
- The API reference is located [here](https://docs.kevin.eu/)

## Cross-platform support

At the moment **Flutter** and **React Native** integrations are supported. Please check our [docs](https://developer.kevin.eu/mobile/) for a tutorial on how to do it.

## Contributing

Please first open an issue describing what you want to build if it is a major change so that we can discuss how to move forward. Otherwise, go ahead and open a pull request for minor changes such as typo fixes and one liners.
